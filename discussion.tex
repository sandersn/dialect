\end{enumerate}

A big question is why trigrams are so good. All of the fancier feature
sets do worse than trigrams. I should address this in the summary for
sure.

The reason is that the simpler tags are easier to tag. So I recommend
for the real-world analyses with only untagged transcriptions as input
to simply use trigrams.

\section{Comparison to Syntactic Dialectology}

The comparison to syntactic dialectology consists of three
sections. The first section looks at the general expectations of
dialectology with respect to correlation with geographic distance. The
second section compares the regions of Sweden to the ones found by the
statistical dialect measures. The third section finishes by comparing
specific phenomena of dialect regions to the corresponding features
from interview sites.

\subsection{General Expectations}

The default expectation of dialect distance is that it should
correlate with geographic distance, see \namecite{chambers98} and
\namecite{gooskens04a}. This is especially true for the Scandinavian
languages; \namecite{hallberg05} points out that Swedish dialect areas
form a continuous gradient without any strong boundaries. This means a
particularly strong correlation between geography and
dialect. Therefore, the first step is to compare the correlation of
geographic distance with dialect distance as measured
here.

Unfortunately, the correlation between geographic distance and dialect
distance are uniformly low, even when they do attain significance. The
highest correlation is 0.36. Correlating with travel distance rather
than geographic distance gives 0.37. However, as Gooskens point out, travel
distance at the beginning of the 21st century is considerably less
than it was one hundred years ago or more. Measuring travel time
between sites at some point in the past as she does might improve the
correlation substantially.

However, the overall pattern agrees with Hallberg's analysis; there is
a north-to-south gradient that is fairly smooth; the composite cluster
maps (map \ref{map-composite-5-1000}, for example) show this pattern
best, but the consensus tree and MDS maps do as well. The exceptions
to this gradient are the cities, as well as the two southern provinces
Sk\.ana and Blekinge. These two exceptions will be discussed more in
the next section.

\subsection{Dialect Regions}
% so which is it? A citry/country divide or is just that the
% traditional areas were Right All Along.
% I guess upon reflection, it's probably the latter...

Although Sweden does not have strong dialect boundaries according to
dialectology, it does have some traditional dialect areas. However,
these are loosely defined and do not have sharp borders; the Eastern
area is centred around Stockholm, the Western around G\"oteborg; the
Southern around Malm\"o, and the Northern area covers the north of
Sweden. In addition, the island of Gotland is in a separate area. The
MDS maps and consensus tree maps reproduce these areas with varying
degrees of fidelity.

For example, in the consensus tree map \ref{map-consensus-5-1000}, the
cyan cluster corresponds to the Northern and Western dialect areas,
the orange cluster corresponds to the Eastern area, and the red/yellow
cluster corresponds to the Southern. There is a question that arises
from this grouping, though; why should the northern and western areas
appear in the consensus tree as one group? It looks as if the
consensus tree map makes it more important that they differ from the
East and South than that the differ from each other. The MDS maps
reinforce this point; they show that the western sites and northern sites
are different from each other, while the southern and eastern sites
are usually quite close in colour.

The boundary between the Sk\.ane and Blekinge is quite abrupt,
presumably mirroring the former Danish border that existed until the
end of the Middle Ages. This contradicts Hallberg, who explicitly
mentions that the dialectology research finds no border there, and
that the strongest north/south division more closely approximates
\quotecite{leinonen08} diagonal boundary in map
\ref{leinonen-factors-3-4}.

There are three possible explanations for this: first, there could be
statistical, accumulative evidence which Swedish dialectologists have
missed; second, the Swediasyn interview sites may be missing; in
particular, there are very few in Sm\.aland; third, the dialect
landscape may have changed since the prevailing dialectology opinion
was established. I believe that the first option is the best; the
third is attractive, since the Swedia corpus is around 50 years newer
than most previous data. However, this boundary mirrors a political
border that existed over 400 years ago. It would be odd for it to
disappear for over 350 years and suddenly re-appear. Instead, it's
more likely that the statistical methods of this dissertation for
syntax and those that Leinonen used for phonology capture a number of
intermittent phenomena that are not recognised by dialectologists.
The second option may in fact be true, considering that Leinonen's
results reproduce the boundary that Hallberg mentions, but it does not
invalidate the boundary that the syntactic measure detects, since her
results reproduce it as well.

% remember, these produce a
%   city/country divide, a boundary at Jamshog, and something kind of
%   near Goteborg.

The literature for Swedish syntactic dialectology is not large;
although it is not large anywhere, Swedish dialectology is not a very
large field. I will compare my results to two papers,
\namecite{delsing03} and \namecite{rosenkvist07}. The first paper is a
survey of syntactic dialectology from the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. In the same volume, other papers analyse specific phenomena
in more detail; the survey is mostly concerned with the differences
and distributions rather than the syntactic analysis. The second
is an analysis of the South Swedish Apparent Cleft.

\subsection{Dialect Features}

\namecite{delsing03} surveys a number of dialectology studies. These
studies date from the height of the field in Sweden, from circa
1880--1930, which Delsing at times augments with modern data. It is
worth noting that the Swedia data in the comparison was collected
around 2000, so there were likely changes in the dialects in the
intervening 70--120 years. This is particularly true in the northern
dialect areas, where improved travel and communication have
levelled the dialects considerably \cite{hallberg05}.

% The gerunds in this paragraph suck and turn it into a
% single-sentence thing.
However, comparison to the eight phenomena in the survey are too
useful to ignore, so with those limitations in mind, for each
phenomenon I will start with a summary of the phenomenon for Swedish
dialects. Then I will identify the relevant interview sites and
represent the phenomenon in terms of the feature sets used throughout
this dissertation. This is somewhat difficult; the features are mostly
designed for ease of automatic tagging and extraction. When they
capture syntactic differences between two regions, they do so in a way
that can be hard to translate to linguistic analyses. For this initial
analysis, trigram features are used because they are simple. This
matches Delsing's survey descriptions, which are for the most part
surface-oriented; other papers in the same volume with the survey
analyse the phenomena in more detail.

With the target sites and features defined, it is straightforward to count the
number of occurrences of each feature in each site and compare the
two. If the predicted dialect phenomenon is reflected in the data,
then the sites associated with the phenomenon will have more
occurrences of the target features than the non-associated sites. This
difference is precisely what the distance measures use.

This method is inadequate for two reasons: first, the translation of
linguistic analysis to feature representation will not be perfect and
may miss some valid instances of the linguistic phenomenon. Second,
more importantly, the differences are not yet checked for statistical
significance. As such, the comparison can only be suggestive;
checking for statistical significance will have to wait for future
work.

% As an aside, much of this missing information IS available to me, so I
% could look manually. But none of it made it through to the distance
% measures, and this analysis compares the way the distance measures
% make the decisions with the way that linguists make their
% decisions. So I have to use only the information that the distance
% measures used.

The maps reproduced here are taken from Delsing's survey.

\subsubsection{``Partitive'' Article}

Northern Sweden uses the suffixed article much more than the rest of
Sweden. Delsing says the reason is that some uses of the suffix
article are not definite in the north; they have a partitive function,
similar to the partitive article in French, which is not marked in the
rest of the country. (There is also a use of the suffixed article in
predicative constructions, but this is probably not related). See
figure \ref{partitive-article} for an example.


\begin{figure}
  {\it H\"a finns vattne d\"ari hinken.} \\
  Here found the-water in the-bucket \\
  There is water in the bucket. \\
  \caption{Suffix marking for partitive}
  \label{partitive-article}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, the part-of-speech tag set used for this
dissertation does not record whether nouns are marked with the
definite suffix. Therefore, there is no way to tell the difference
between suffixed dialect usage and bare standard usage. This feature
must be skipped because it cannot be compared.

\subsubsection{Proper-Noun Articles}

In Northern Scandinavia, first names are preceded by an indefinite
article, and sometimes last names as well. It also includes the
kinship terms that are used as proper names. Standard Swedish does not
include this feature. In Sweden, this feature is found along the border
with Norway as well as Northern Sweden. In our data, this includes the
interview sites K\"ola, Indal, and Anundsj\"o. An example is given in
figure \ref{indefinite-article-proper-noun}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{dialektboka-karta3}
  \caption{Proper-Noun Articles}
  \label{indefinite-article-proper-noun-map}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  {\it En Bjurstr\"om ha aff\"arn.} \\
  A Bjurstr\"om has the-store. \\
  Bjurstr\"om has a store. \\
  \caption{Indefinite Article for Proper Nouns: First Names}
  \label{indefinite-article-proper-noun}
\end{figure}

Unlike the partitive article suffix, this feature is easy to detect
with simple features. Specifically, it can be represented as the
bigram EN-PN (indefinite article-proper noun), which can be used as a
search term in the trigram feature set. The same EN-PN sequence is
expected for leaf-head paths, since the indefinite article depends on
proper noun. The phrase-structure-rule features should
look something like NP$\to$EN-PN.

Occurrences of the EN-PN bigram in the trigram feature set for
Leksand, Indal and K\"ola agree with the linguistic analysis: a rate
of 0.00007 versus 0.00006. Unfortunately, this result can hardly be
trusted because the rate of occurrence for both regions is so rare, as
well as so close between the two regions. The only conclusion that can
be drawn is that the hypothesis is not yet disproven.

\subsubsection{Possessives and the article}

In Swedish, and in the other Scandinavian countries, there is a good
deal of variation in the handling of possessives with articles. In
Swedish, normally only one is allowed in a noun phrase: either a
possessive or a determiner, but not both. However, in Danish and the
Danish-influenced areas of Sweden, both are allowed in certain
cases. When the possessive and determiner are separated from the noun
by an adjective, both are allowed. Delsing gives an example from
Danish, copied here in figure \ref{possessive-plus-article-example}.
This pattern is also standard in the southwest corner of Sweden, very
near to Denmark. This includes the interview site Bara. In addition,
it alternates with the standard on the island of Gotland, which
includes the interview sites Fole, F\.ar\"o and Sproge.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{dialektboka-karta4}
  \caption{Proper-Noun Articles}
  \label{possessive-plus-article-map}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  {\it naboens den stribede kat} \\
  Neighbours' the striped cat \\
  The neighbours' striped cat.
  \caption{Simultaneous possessive and determiner in noun phrase in
    Danish}
  \label{possessive-plus-article-example}
\end{figure}

This pattern can be detected by looking for the
4-grams PO-PO-AJ-NN, PR-PO-AJ-NN and NN-PO-AJ-NN. The first is the
sequence pronoun-pronoun-adjective-noun, for example {\it mitt det
  gamla huset} ``My the old house-the''. The second starts with a
proper name, such as {\it Pers} ``Per's'', and the third starts with a
noun, such as {\it naboen} ``neighbour's''. These three 4-tag sequence
can be encoded as trigrams by breaking them into two pieces.

In addition to this pattern, there is a second in the north of
Sweden. Here, it is simply that possessive personal pronouns are
allowed both before and after the noun. This pattern includes the
interview sites Indal and Anundsj\"o and is covered in the next
section.

Searching Bara, in the southwest of Sweden, for the previously
mentioned trigram patterns does not find them: the rate of occurrence
is 0.00289 inside Bara but 0.000341 outside. It should be higher in
Bara. However, Delsing also mentions that Scanians he has asked do not
recognise this form either, so it is possible that it has fallen out
of use in the 70 years or so since it was last reported.

Executing a similar search for the Gotland sites (F\.ar\"o, Fole and
Sproge), but with the addition of the standard trigrams PO-AJ-NN,
PR-AJ-NN and NN-AJ-NN, shows similar results: 0.00441 on Gotland,
0.00495 off.

The final region in map \ref{possessive-plus-article-map}, in northern
Sweden, which includes Indal and Andundsj\"o, is actually more
complicated than can be captured by the part-of-speech tags used here;
this region allows possessive proper nouns to occur with
suffix-determiner nouns. But this can occur in either order: for
example, both ``Pers huset'' and ``huset Pers'' is allowed. Although
both ``Pers hus'' and ``Pers huset'' produce identical tags (PR-NN),
trigrams encode order, so the unusual order in ``huset Pers'' can be
searched for.

Searching for the bigrams NN-PN (noun-proper noun) and NN-PO
(noun-pronoun) shows a usage rate of 0.02532 for Indal and Anundsj\"o
and a rate of 0.02438 for the rest of Sweden. This is the expected
direction, but the rate of usage is very similar between the two
regions. The comparison is really too close to make a prediction
because the difference is not likely to be significant.

% \subsubsection{Pronominal Possessives}

% In Swedish, as well all of mainland Scandinavian, another possessive
% construction is the reflexive genitive, which consists of a
% noun-reflexive-noun sequence. An example is given in figure
% \ref{genitive-reflexive-normal-example}. However, this construction
% does not allow pronouns: the sequence noun-reflexive-pronoun is not
% allowed (see figure \ref{genitive-reflexive-pronoun-example}).

% \begin{figure}
%   {\it Per sitt hus} \\
%   Per its house
% ``Per's house'' \\
% \caption{Standard Swedish genitive reflexive construction}
% \label{genitive-reflexive-normal-example}
% \end{figure}

% \begin{figure}
%   {\it han sitt hus} \\
%   his its house
% ``his house'' \\
% \caption{Pronominal genitive reflexive construction}
% \label{genitive-reflexive-pronoun-example}
% \end{figure}

% However, this construction is allowed in NORTHERN SWEDEN.
% Oops, actually I think this whole section is whole throwaway intro to
% something else. Boooooo.

% However, this is not allowed with possessive pronouns:
% *{\it han sitt hus}.

% The prepositional genitive
% behaves the same way: {\it huset till Per} ``Per's
% house'' (gloss: house-the of Per) is legal but *{\it huset till meg}
% ``my house'' (gloss: house-the of me) is not.

% There is an exception for kinship words, which I don't understand
% yet. But somehow ``far min'' is different (maybe just because it's not
% ``min far''?)

% So basically standard Swedish allows trigrams sequences like NN-PO-NN
% ({\it Per sitt hus}) but not PO-PO-NN ({\it han sitt hus}). It also
% allows sequence like NN-PR-NN ({\it huset till Per}) but not NN-PR-PO
% ({\it huset till meg}).

% Does not work (is too close to call): 0.02229 vs 0.2429

% Reversing the bigram, looking for PO-NN in the south gives
% Works (but is still super close): 0.04243 vs 0.03998

% It looks like one set just uses more nouns than the others or
% something. Conclusion: inconclusive, leaning toward no---it looks like
% they're the same.

\subsubsection{Proper Noun Possessives}

In addtion to the post-nominal possessive pattern of the previous
section, there is a variant that is common in Norway. Here, the
sequence is noun-possessive pronoun-proper noun. An example
of this pattern is given in figure \ref{proper-noun-post-possessive}.

\begin{figure}
  {\it Huset hans Per} \\
  The-house his Per \\
  Per's house
  \caption{Possessive formed of Possessive Pronoun and Proper Noun}
  \label{proper-noun-post-possessive}
\end{figure}

This pattern overlaps slightly into Sweden, covering the interview
site K\"ola. The distribution is given in map
\ref{proper-noun-post-possessive-map}. Note that the northern area
with small stripes is the same as in map
\ref{possessive-plus-article-map}. The area of interest is the first,
with larger, thick stripes.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{dialektboka-karta6}
  \caption{Proper-Noun Possessives}
  \label{proper-noun-post-possessive-map}
\end{figure}

This phenomenon maps to a trigram NN-PO-PN: noun-pronoun-proper
noun. The occurrence rate of this trigram in K\"ola to the rest of
Sweden is 0 vs 0.00001. This is the wrong direction, and the value is
so low that it is probably noise. There are two possible causes for
this essentially zero result: either neither region has this feature
or there is not sufficient data to tell.

\subsubsection{Noun possessives}

Delsing mentions briefly that central Sweden, including \"Alvdalen and
V\"asterdalarna, uses the dative form of nouns for the
s-genitive. However, the part-of-speech tag set used here makes no
difference between dative and other cases on nouns, so it is not
possible to look for this phenomenon.

\subsubsection{Double indefinite}

In northern Sweden and northern Norway, indefinite articles are used both
before and after adjectives when modifying nouns. Delsing calls this
the ``double indefinite''. See for example figure
\ref{double-indefinite-example}. One indefinite article is used after
each adjective, even for multiple adjectives, so {\it en stor en bil}
(a large car) but also {\it en stor en fin en bil} (a large fine car).

\begin{figure}
  {\it en stor en bil} \\
  a large a car \\
  A large car
  \caption{Double Indefinite}
  \label{double-indefinite-example}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{dialektboka-karta8}
  \caption{Double indefinite (post-adjectival articles)}
  \label{double-indefinite-map}
\end{figure}

In central Sweden, a similar pattern occurs, but the article is not
perceived as independent, but as a suffix of the adjective. In other
words, the above example is perceived as {\it en stor-en bil}
instead. Unfortunately, this pattern appears identical to the ordinary
Swedish case given the course part-of-speech tag set in use.
In constrast, the first pattern is quite easy to represent with
trigrams: we are interested in the 4-gram EN-AJ-EN-NN and the 6-gram
EN-AJ-EN-AJ-EN-NN---alternating series of indefinite articles and
adjectives ended by a noun. The larger n-grams can be broken into the
trigrams EN-AJ-EN and AJ-EN-NN.

This is a northern pattern which includes the interview sites
Anundsj\"o and Indal. When measured, these trigrams occur at a rate of
0.00054 there versus the rest of Sweden, which has a rate of
0.00012. From this we can conclude that this is a rare phenomenon, but
one that happens in the north about 4 times more often than in the
rest of Sweden.

\subsubsection{Double Definite}

Double-definite with adjectives is standard in Sweden and Norway,
where there is a definite article as well as a definite suffix on the
noun (see figure \ref{double-definite-example}). This is not the case
in Denmark (figure \ref{single-definite-example}), where the definite
suffix disappears in case of a definite article, nor in Iceland, where
the definite is suffix-only and there is no article (figure
\ref{single-definite-suffix-example}).

However, in North Sweden, there is a fourth option, where the
adjective combines with the noun into a single word (figure
\ref{adjective-single-definite-suffix-example}). Delsing gives
examples like {\it storhuset} (the big house) and {\it
  stor-svart-gamm-katta} (the big, black, old cat). In Norrland,
Delsing finds that this construction is used almost to the exclusion
of the normal Swedish one. Further south, the two co-exist.

\begin{figure}
  {\it det store huset} \\
  The large the-house \\
  The large house
  \caption{Double definite (Sweden and Norway)}
  \label{double-definite-example}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
  {\it Det store hus} \\
  The large house\\
  The large house
  \caption{Single Indefinite (Denmark)}
  \label{single-definite-example}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
  {\it gamla h\'usid} \\

  The old house
  \caption{Single definite suffix (Iceland)}
  \label{single-definite-suffix-example}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
  {\it storhuset} \\
  old-house-the \\
  The old house
  \caption{Single definite suffix with combined adjective (Northern Sweden)}
  \label{adjective-single-definite-suffix-example}
\end{figure}

Therefore, since the annotation scheme does not differentiate between
a combined noun like {\it storhuset} and a normal noun like {\it
  huset}, the better way to detect the region difference is to count
the rate of normal trigrams like PO-AJ-NN (pronoun-adjective-noun);
this is the feature type that occurs rarely or not at all in the
north. If the region division in map \ref{double-definite-map} is
detected, then northern Sweden will have a lower rate of occurrence of
these standard trigrams.

As before, the two northern sites are Indal and Anundsj\"o. The rate
of PO-AJ-NN in this region is 0.00152, compared to 0.00216 for the
rest of Sweden. This difference is in the right direction, and it is
larger than most of the other comparisons here, but of course it has
not been checked for significance so it is currently just suggestive.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{dialektboka-karta9}
  \caption{Double definite (and combined adjectives)}
  \label{double-definite-map}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Rosenkvist's Analysis of the South Swedish Apparent Cleft}

\namecite{rosenkvist07} analyses a phenomenon he calls the South
Swedish Apparent Cleft. It involves an embedded clause, similar to a
cleft, but with no clefted constituent. Instead, subordinating
conjunction {\it som} is directly preceded by the verb or an adverb
expressing speaker attitude. The subject of of the {\it som}-clause
must be a pronoun, though Rosenkvist notes that this may be a
pragmatic, not a syntactic, restriction. The two main variants are
given in figures \ref{apparent-cleft-example1} and
\ref{apparent-cleft-example2}, but is also found in yes/no questions
and embedded clauses.

\begin{figure}
  {\it Det \"ar som han har missuppfattat.} \\
  it is {\it som} he has misunderstood \\
  He has misunderstood.
  \caption{Apparent Cleft}
  \label{apparent-cleft-example1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  {\it Det \"ar bara som han finner p\.a.} \\
  it is only {\it som} he finds-on \\
  He just makes it up.
  \caption{Apparent Cleft with adverb expressing speaker attitude}
  \label{apparent-cleft-example2}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, Rosenkvist does not give a comprehensive syntactic
analysis of the apparent cleft. This means that a translation to our
feature set based on his description will necessarily be
surface-oriented in the same way this his analysis and results are
surface-oriented.

Accordingly, translating the sequences like {\it Det \"ar som han
  \ldots} gives the 4-gram PO-AV-UK-PO, and {\it Det \"ar bara som han
  \ldots} gives the 5-gram PO-AV-AB-UK-PO (pronoun-be
verb-adverb-subordinating conjunction-pronoun). Although these
part-of-speech sequences can obviously appear in other contexts, they
should appear more in the region that has apparent clefts than in the
region that does not. Converting these sequences to trigrams is
straightforward, producing 5 unique trigrams of interest.

Rosenkvist captures the geographical distribution of the apparent
cleft in two ways. He first consults two collections of Swedish
novels, using the authors' birthplaces as proxies for their
dialect. Second, he uses the results of a questionnaire that he issued
to university students at several Swedish universities: Stockholm,
Gothenburg, Lund and Ume\.a.

Using author birthplace as a proxy for dialect, the apparent cleft is
seen throughout southern and middle Sweden---this includes all the
interview sites except \.Arsunda, Indal and Anundsj\"o. However, based
on the survey results, the apparent cleft is only accepted by speakers
from Halland, Sm\.aland and Sk\.ane. This includes the interview sites
Frilles\.as, V\.axtorp, Ankarsrum, Tors\.as, Bara, L\"oderup, Norra
Rorum and \"Ossj\"o.

Therefore, the test for this comparison is the occurrence rates
for the 5 trigrams based on the two common forms Rosenkvist gives as
examples, with two variations: one region division based on author
birthplaces and one region division based on the student survey. The
southern region in both cases should have more occurrences of the
target trigrams.

For the larger cleft region division based on author birthplaces, the
comparison goes in the expected direction: a rate of 0.02430 in the
south and 0.02427 in the north. But these rates are so close identical
that they should not be regarded as different. For the smaller divison
based on the student survey, the comparison goes in the opposite
direction: 0.02264 in the south and 0.02491 in the north. Again, this
is not much of a difference.

With such a small difference, it is not possible to draw any
conclusions or even suggest whether the distance measures will consistently
notice this difference. One problem is that it hard to capture a
phenomenon like this with trigrams, where the surface form is only
subtly different from that produced by other syntactic structures. A
more complete syntactic analysis of the phenomenon is needed so that
more advanced feature sets from dialectometry can be used to compare
to the results from dialectology.

\subsection{Conclusion}

The dialect constructions surveyed here do not support the agreement
of the new dialectometry results with existing dialectology results
nearly as well as the previous sections which compared the results at
a less detailed level. The larger problem is that no good method yet
exists for doing so; the differences were in some cases large enough
to suggest directions, but without significance testing, it is not
possible to know. In fact, it is possible that the small differences
are significant, and already being used by the distance measures to
distinguish regions; after all, the aggregation of many small
differences is the inherent in the working of the statistical approach
in this dissertation.

\section{Comparison to Phonological Dialectometry}

The comparison to phonological dialectometry is currently difficult
because there has been so little work to date on Swedish. The only
paper at the time of this writing is \namecite{leinonen08}. It uses
factor analysis to characterise the distribution of nine phonological
variables across Sweden, but does not cluster the sites based on these
variables. In other words, it is equivalent to the analysis of feature
rankings presented in chapter \ref{results-chapter}. Since the
syntactic and phonological features can not be compared directly, I will
attempt to compare Leinonen's individual feature maps to my composite
cluster and MDS maps. This is still a comparison of maps based on
single features rather than aggregrates, so it must be taken as
preliminary.

However, Leinonen's dissertation, currently unpublished, will cover
phonological dialectometry of Sweden comprehensively. In future work,
a better comparison should be possible, since both dissertations are
based on the same corpus.

Looking at Leinonen's first two maps, reproduced here as figure
\ref{leinonen-factors-1-2}, we see patterns similar to the
city/country difference from the syntactic results: in the first diagram,
Stockholm and Uppsala differ from the rest of the country, and in the
second Stockholm, Uppsala and Malm\"o areas all differ.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{leinonen-factors-1-2}
  \caption{Factors 1 and 2 of Swedish vowels}
  \label{leinonen-factors-1-2}
\end{figure}

In Leinonen's third and fouth maps (figure \ref{leinonen-factors-3-4}),
there is a north/south divide roughly half way between Stockholm and
Malm\"o. This boundary generally reflects the north/south
gradient from my results. However, the phonological boundary is stronger and more
localised than numerous small syntactic ones, such as those seen in
the composite cluster map \ref{map-composite-5-1000}.

The fifth map (figure \ref{leinonen-factors-5-6}) is more specific
than the previous four; most of the sites are blue, but there are a
few in the south that are much yellower than the rest. These are the
same three sites that form the red cluster in
figure \ref{red-cluster} from the consensus tree
results: J\"amshog, \"Ossj\"o and Tors\.as. The sixth map, however,
shows a clear east/west divide that is not reflected in my data.

The level of agreement between the phonological results and syntactic
results is quite high. Of the six variables Leinonen illustrates with
map, all but one reflect some aspect of the combined syntactic
results. The precision with which Leinonen's fifth variable matches
the red cluster from the consensus tree results is surprising for
statistical methods. This discussion is not precise, but it provides
hope that a quantitative comparison between the two result sets will
support high agreement with statistical evidence.

\section{Comparison to Syntactic Dialectometry}

In my previous work on British English, this method failed to find
agreement between syntactic distance ($R$) and phonological distance
(Levenshtein) distance---there was no
significant correlation between the two methods. Although both showed
something like a North/South distinction in Britain, its orientation was much more
obvious from phonological distance. This lack of agreement was a
preliminary answer to the question of whether multiple
ways of measuring linguistic distance give the same results.

However, there were at least five reasonable explanations for the difference
between the two distance measures.
% First, and
% least satisfying, is the possibility that one of the distances is not
% measuring what it is supposed to. Second, the corpora may not agree
% because of the 40 year difference in age and differing collection
% methodologies. Third, syntactic and phonological dialect markers may
% not share the same boundaries.

\begin{enumerate}
\item One or both of the distances does not measure what it is supposed to.
\item The two corpora may not agree on dialect boundaries because of
  their 40-year difference in age.
\item Place of birth, as recorded in the ICE, may not correlate well
  with spoken dialect, especially given variations in speaker
  education level and place of residence.
\item Dialect boundaries may appear from systematic variation in
  annotation practices rather than the speech.
\item Syntactic and phonological dialect boundaries may be different.
\end{enumerate}

Of these, this dissertation addresses the second, third and fourth
problems directly by using a single corpus, Swedia2000, annotated by a single
person. (TODO: This may not be true for the phonological annotation.)
By finding significant distances between all interview sites of
Swedia2000, it also suggests that $R$ is measuring syntax
distance. PROBABLY.

The last is the most interesting because previous work will not have
exposed this difference. Traditional dialectometry focuses on a strong
agreement among a few features from each collection site. Because
syntactic features are fewer in number than phonological ones, they
are under-represented in this type of analysis. Unfortunately, this
means that the syntactic contribution to isogloss bundles is
correspondingly reduced. In addition, because of isogloss bundles'
insensitivity to rare variations, syntactic features rarely contribute
to isogloss bundles of successful dialect boundaries.
% I really need to CITE this.

In contrast, computational analysis, such as \cite{shackleton07},
captures feature variation precisely using statistical analysis and
sophisticated algorithms. The resulting analysis displays dialects as
gradient phenomena, displaying much more complexity than the
corresponding isogloss analysis. But current specialized computational
methods only apply to phonology. Syntactic data cannot be analyzed
without a syntax-specific method.

This paper attempts to address that lack, and provide some first steps
to show whether syntax and phonology assist each other in establishing
dialects, or whether their dialect regions are unrelated. If they are not
related, and syntactic gradients can be as weak as phonological ones,
then some new dialect regions may become apparent that were not visible in
previous phonology-only analyses.

\subsection{Improvements on British Dialect Experiment}

This dissertation improves on the British experiment in a number of
ways. It addresses the obvious criticism that syntax distance on the
ICE requires so much data that the results are no more informative
syntax those of traditional dialectology---its precision lags
phonological distance methods badly. However, $R$ works with much
smaller corpora when run on Swedia2000. This shows that the problem
with the British experiment is not the distance method, but the
corpus, which fails to capture dialect differences. Most likely is
that the interviewees, mostly in a college setting, actively tried to
suppress dialect differences during the interview.

Another problem with the current study is the 40-year difference in
collection dates between the phonological corpus and the syntactic
corpus. A recent phonological corpus would likely show the same sort
of changes in the North/South divide that show up in the syntactic
corpus. The British population became more mobile during the second
half of the 20th century, and the SED survey explicitly attempted to capture
the dialects that existed before this happened \cite{orton78}.
It would also be nice to have data from the rest of the United Kingdom for
comparison as well, or at least Scotland and Wales as with the ICE.


% TODO: integrate this.
% Alternatively, I could just look at the region pairs that fail to
% achieve significance in the syntactic permutation test and check to
% see if their phonological distance is lower than the other pairs. I
% don't do this (yet).

One interesting question is
how phonological and syntactic distances correlate with geographic
distance---\namecite{gooskens04a} shows that often the correlation is
very good. This would also allow better visualization of dialect areas
than a hierarchical dendrogram.

\section{Future Work}

Try all those smarter variants of $R$.

Include the rest of Nodalida once it is done.

Better normalisation and feature ranking are needed. It appears that
the current normalisations vary either in favouring differences
only in high-frequency features OR in favouring rare features so much
that the most important appear to be those that only occur in one of
the two regions.

Quantitative comparison to phonology. There is a dissertation out for
it now, based on the same data. So it should be easy.

Better comparison to dialectology.
NOTE for conclusions: But this has taken some time in phonology too. (at least 8-10
years) so this is not such a big problem.

Better parsers!

\section{The End}

This dissertation contributes a better understanding of syntax with
respect to dialectometry. It establishes that statistical methods can
find interesting things, and with not much more data than is expected
of previous dialectometry in other areas. Remember, the majoriy of
interviews used here were less than 1000 sentences. Previous work
pointed the way (Nerbonne \& Wiersma (2006) and Sanders (2008)) but
failed to establish the utility and reliability of these methods
either by lack of dialect application or by lack of consistent
results. This dissertation addresses these shortcomings
comprehensively.

In addition, it points the way toward future work in Swedish; while
the results here are interesting, it is difficult to corraborate them
solidly because of the lack of study on Swedish dialects, both in
dialectology and dialectometry. This gap in the literature is on its
way to being remedied with the work of Leinonen in dialectometry and
X,Y,Z in dialectology.

Like its findings, future directions based on this work are
twofold. In general dialectometry, syntactic investigations should
begin, hopefully extending to languages for which the syntactic
variation is already well-studied.

In Swedish, I hope that this investigation of syntactic dialect
variation will lead to further work in this area; there is little
enough right now, and perhaps a computer-generated overview of the
interesting features will spark some new avenues of investigation for
linguists.

%%%%%%%%% cut two (raw) %%%%%%%%%

This dissertation establishes that statistical methods for syntactic
dialectometry can be useful. The results show that significant
distances can be obtained, which was shown by earlier work and not
much else. They show that dialect distances correlate with geographic
distance for many parameter settings. Clustering dialect distances
reproduces two well-known aspects of Swedish dialects: the Scanian
border, and a north-to-south gradient, as well as a previously unremarked
aspect: differences between the cities and the
countryside. Mult-dimensional scaling produces the same
results. Finally, interesting features have been discovered from these
same clusters, but features in the dialectology literature do not
necessarily appear.

In summary, this dissertation has answered its questions with some
degree of accuracy. Although the more complete verification is still
missing, it points the way for practical studies in the future: many
parameter variations are explored and the most efficacious are pointed
out.
